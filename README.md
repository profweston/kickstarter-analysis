# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns
## Overview of Project
Famous playwright, Louise, is ready to release her lastest creation, *Fever*, with an estimated budget of $10,000, but utlimately fell short of her fundraising goal. In an effort to improve her future funding, Louise examines data provided by Kickstarter for other fundraising campaigns. Her examination of campaigns in relation to their launch dates and funding goals reveal that campaigns launched during May are most successful and those launched in October fared the worst. 

## Analysis and Challenges
Data used for this analysis comes from Kickstarter and contained 4113 Projects along with their launch date, desired goal of funding, amount pledged to the campaign, and the outcome of the campaign. The outcomes were defined as successful, failed, or canceled. A successful campaign was defined as the total pledged contributions met or exceed the desired goal. A failed campaign was defined as pledged contributions not meeting the desired goal. Canceled campaigns are those that did not continue gathering contributions until the established deadline. 

The first analysis filtered the data to include only those projects categorized as Theater resulting in a total of 1369 total projects.  Data analysis included creating pivot tables by examining the outcomes in relation to the what month of the year the campaign was launched. The pivot table is visually represented in the line graph.

The second analysis filtered the theater category to include on plays specifically. Then a pivot table was created examining the outcome of the campaign in relation to the goal amount.
